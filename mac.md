# Setting Up Your Computer

Welcome to day 1 at BloomTech, today we are going to spend time setting up your computer and learning the tools that you will be using to complete this program. Just like day 1 at a job, you will need to get your environment set up to build and run your code. Complete the set up tasks below and then get started on the research questions. Once you have finished check out the submission instructions in the `README.md` file to turn in your assignment for the day.

## Set Up Tasks

1. [x] [Download xcode](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) - these are your developer tools for mac
2. [x] sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join) - please use a professional username. We recommending using your `firstname` `lastname`
3. [x] [Set up your SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) - GitHub uses SSH to keep their files secure. You will need to set up one SSH key for every computer that you want to access your GitHub account on. Please ensure you go through all of the steps to generate a new key, add a new key and test your connection.
4. [x] [Download Zoom](https://zoom.us/download) - make sure your zoom display name is your `first name` `last name`
5. [x] [Download Slack](https://slack.com/help/articles/207677868-Download-Slack-for-Mac) - make sure your slack display name is your `first name` `last name`
6. [x] [Download VS code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) - this will be the tool you use to write all of your code. We recommend installing the following extensions:

- [ES Lint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- [Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker)
- [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)

7. [x] [Download Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en/) - Please download the latest stable version. We will be using Node.JS to run the tests in all of our javaScript assignments. Test driven development is a common practice in the world of web dev. You can read more about it [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/test-driven-development-what-it-is-and-what-it-is-not-41fa6bca02a2/)
8. [x] Sign up for a free [codepen account](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free)
9. [x] Sign up for a free account on [Lucid Chart](https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/landing?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign[â€¦]tTwOoXp_lCeLTC97pikTFa5cE58FWHwjjpTSGsGPRqR2AAaAh-MEALw_wcB)

## Research Questions

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You can type your answer below the questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en) doc short for documentation are the instructions on how to use a languge, or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your google skills.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and GitHub? Git is used to write/modify code by single/mulitple users. Github is where the repositories of that code are stored. So basically Git is used to interact with code and Github is used to store/transfer it.
2. Why do we create a branch? It isolates the code we are working on from the main code, that way if there are errors it doesn't effect the other users code while it is being worked on.
3. What is the purpose of a pull request? It basically matches or updates content from remote to local repositories.
4. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on a feature branch and you want to switch back to main. git checkout is the command, but -b must be added if a branch does not exist, this will add a branch.
5. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull` what does each command do? Git fetch: it downloads data from a remote repository to your local repository, but does not change your local repository. Git merge: integrates multiple branches into a single branch, Git pull: it gets and downloads content from the remote to the local repository and will match the data, it is like running git fetch and git merge one after the other.
6. What is a merge conflict? How do you resolve a merge conflict? A merge conflict is when two or more people have changed the same line of code, or when a file was deleted while another person was working in that file. To fix a merge conflict, you must use the command line and an editor, so open the terminal-> cd repository name-> list the affected files with git status-> find the changes in the text editor-> delete the conflict markers-> add the changes with git add . -> then commit the change using git commit -m "put a note here about what you did".
